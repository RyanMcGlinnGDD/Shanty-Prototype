# Shanty-Prototype
Shanty functions as a music player app with the specialized functionality of generating short playlists based on the userâ€™s preferences at the time of creation.

Users will specify a time frame representing the approximate duration of the playlist they wish to create.
The user will then be presented with two random songs from their library and be told to pick one or the other to add to the playlist, or to outright reject them both.
This process repeats until the total duration of the songs added to the playlist meets the originally specified time frame.

The playlist can then be launched for listening.

Utilizes Media Player and Media Store classes. Compatible with Android 4.1 and above
